# BigData-PySpark-NYCTaxiAnalysis

In this study, we have investigated the taxi service in New York City, focussing on the difference between Green Taxi and HVFHV. Since 2013, the Green Taxis have been introduces to provide more service to the areas in New York outside Manhattan. Additionally, Uber and similar app-hail services have been active in the market for an extended period. Our research aimed to compare these two taxis, focusing on how the taxis are used for both long and short distance, and when they are preferred (morning, afternoon, evening or the night). Moreover, within our research we found significant changes to the usage of taxis after the pandemic. Our research revealed a stark reality regarding the number of rides for the Green taxis. Between 2019 and 2022, the Green Taxis experienced a decrease of more than 85% of their rides. This decline is noteworthy when compared to HVFHV, which has only saw 9.4% decrease. Despite the Green taxis have been introduces to provide more service outside Manhattan, customers continue to prefer the HVFHV. Lastly, our research indicates that customers prefer the Green Taxi for short- distance travel, while HVFHV is preferred for short to medium distances.
